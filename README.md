# Otto-Man kol eklemiş modeli kodları ve STL dosyaları v1.0

Arduino Kütüphaneleri ve Sketch, bazı temel talimatlar da dahil edilmiştir

## Bilgi

Otto has fully functioning arm movements, this has come with a small price to pay, Some of Otto's mouths have been removed
to allow for the additional memory needed for the arms, these include the numbers 5 -9 and the vampire mouths (sorry)
Also only one animated mouth has been left, the sleeping dreamMouth, again the others have been removed for additional memory,
I think the arm movements are worth the sacrifice.

As an open source library, Otto and Myself respect all contributors to the open source community and thank you very much for everyone's supervision.

If you have a question then please post it to the Otto Builder facebook group, this is also a great place for help and advice.

Difficult to find all the parts? then buy quality kits [from our website only](ottodiy.com), is a way to contribute and support this project to continue growing, so we can continue offering very affordable kits and constantly creating new robots open for all.
After you have all components just follow the instruction manual in the files and build your own Otto in one hour!

If you want make Otto by yourself ;) that is great too! but do not forget to add your [marker in our google map!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qXEfuS5egbF14gi8EUjJ6U-dITHoJJNZ&usp=sharing)

## 3. Share your innovative creation with #OttoDIY
A redesign, modified code or if your creation is different but inspired in Otto; is technically a remix, so please share in our [Wikifactory Social & Design Platform](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY) or please post that you have [made/remix an Otto in Thingiverse and add to this group] (https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/ottodiy) or pull a request here in Github!

Keep sharing with us in any social media, tag friends, family with #OttoDIY and make sure more robot fans do the same everywhere, we love to see Otto robots around the world!

Please help us to spread out the word first in Maker Faires, Maker spaces, Hacker spaces, Schools, Universities, tech events and so on...

## 4. Otto DIY robot for STEAM education 
Educational deep content for STEAM centers, we already partner with many tech companies, entrepreneurs, educational centers and schools around the world, just contact us to be an official collaborator, we easily adapt to different curriculum or needs and we can leverage your ideas too!
